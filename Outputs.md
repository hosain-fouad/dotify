# Output formats #
## PEF ##
PEF is the main output format.
## Ascii Braille ##
Ascii braille is supported for a variety of locales (inherited from Braille Utils).
## Plain text ##
Plain text is supported. Either bypassing translation or outputting Unicode braille.
If translation is bypassed, row lengths are measured in characters (which may require more braille cells when viewed with a braille display).
## OBFL ##
OBFL output is supported for later use, or debugging.
