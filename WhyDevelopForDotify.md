# Why Develop for Dotify? #

If your organization is looking for a new Braille production system, you may be asking yourselves: why develop for Dotify?

Dotify delivers a unique set of abilities that, once combined, no other Braille production framework can offer today.

## Java Based ##
Dotify is a pure Java framework which makes it suitable for various applications including workstations, servers and embedded systems without changes to the code. Run on a server today and embed the same code in a device tomorrow.

## Designed for High-Volume, Automated Use ##
Dotify has been designed for high-volume, automated use from the very beginning, prioritizing reliability and error free output over a "best effort" approach typically utilized in end-user systems.

## Designed for High Quality Braille ##
Dotify does not compromise with braille quality in order to fit a set of predetermined design restrictions. If a feature is required for a locale, we aim to make it possible to implement. Dotify does not tell you what good Braille should be like.

## Open Source ##
Dotify is Open Source, this means that everyone has the right to continue to develop for it and suggest new features.

## Modular ##
Dotify aims at a modular design of functional units that can be replaced or integrated into other solutions individually.
