# Introduction #
The DotifyFormatter project in the code repository is an important part of Dotify. DotifyFormatter builds the formatting component that is used in Dotify. It translates an OBFL-file to braille.

# Building #
This project requires that DotifyShared is available on the same level in the workspace.

Also note that the project now depends on a number of the OSGi-bundle projects in the trunk. These must be checked out as well in order to build the component. Refer to the ant build for a complete list of required projects.
